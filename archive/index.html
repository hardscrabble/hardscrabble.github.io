    <li><a href='https://github.com/maxjacobson/bluff'>Bluff</a> &mdash; an online game I made in 2020 during the Coronavirus pandemic &mdash; formerly online at <code>bluff.website</code> but I stopped paying for it and now something else is there</li> 
    <li><a href='/talks/there-are-no-rules-in-ruby/'>There are no rules in Ruby</a> &mdash; a tech talk I gave at RubyConf 2017</li>
    <li><a href='/metaphorloop'>Metaphor Loop</a> &mdash; a podcast I sporadically produced between 2015 and 2017 in which I interviewed interesting programmer friends about how they think about the process of learning programming.</li>
  </ul>
