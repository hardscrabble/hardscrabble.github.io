    <li><a href='https://bluff.website'>Bluff</a> &mdash; an online game I made in 2020 during the Coronavirus pandemic &mdash; ⚠️ currently broken due to running on a free Heroku plan that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/25/heroku-announces-plans-to-eliminate-free-plans-blaming-fraud-and-abuse/">is no longer available</a></li> 
    <li><a href='/talks/there-are-no-rules-in-ruby/'>There are no rules in Ruby</a> &mdash; a tech talk I gave at RubyConf 2017</li>
    <li><a href='/metaphorloop'>Metaphor Loop</a> &mdash; a podcast I sporadically produced between 2015 and 2017 in which I interviewed interesting programmer friends about how they think about the process of learning programming.</li>
