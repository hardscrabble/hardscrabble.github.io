My new homepage?

## working on the site

* Run `bundle` to get the necessary gems.
* Run `guard` to watch & compile the scss and coffeescript.
* Run `jekyll serve -w` to build and preview the site at <http://localhost:4000>

## todo

* check if it's even necessary to use 24 hour time. it probably checks and parses 12 hour just fine
