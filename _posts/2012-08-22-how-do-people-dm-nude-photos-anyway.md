After the Anthony Weiner storyline on The Newsroom I'm reminded of something I was wondering about back then. How the heck do people even DM nude photos? Or any photos? It's certainly not a feature that Twitter supports and I have a feeling they don't want to start now, lest they be seen as enabling the perverts.

(Like email and Facebook do)

I suppose it's not a difficult thing to upload a photo to a service like [Droplr](http://droplr.com) or [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com) or [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), then link to it. These sites are the kind of semi-private where there's no password, but the random URL provides some protection. You just have to trust that your friend won't share the link.

And not tweet it yourself.

What did Weiner do? I can't find the tweet. But I'd be surprised if he was using a nerdy service like that.

Oooh okay so I just now decided to do a smidge of research and according to [the wikipedia page about the scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner_sexting_scandal), he posted it to [yfrog](http://yfrog.com). _YFROG??_ Really? I had assumed it wasn't anything like yfrog or twitpic, because those are inherently public. Even if you don't tweet a link to your photo, it's available on your public yfrog profile ([here's mine](http://yfrog.com/user/maxjacobson/photos) which I've never deliberately updated or signed up for, for what that's worth). So what the hell was he thinking?

I should re-write this post to be called, like, **How To Send Nude DMs Without Getting Caught** or some shit, dag.
