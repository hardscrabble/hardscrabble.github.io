I have a [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) snippet for quickly inserting the current time. I write `ttime` and it inserts, say, 10:43 PM. In that format. If it were an hour earlier, it would say 9:43 PM. No leading zero.

This is what was screwing up my sorting method.

I want posts to be sorted based on both date and time, so if there are multiple posts in a day they'll show up in the right order instead of just alphabetically.

I could have just written those leading zeros manually or I could've just used a twenty-four hour clock, but I like my snippet how it is and want my code to come to me rather than the other way around.

So I'll share my method because I'm sure in as little as a month I'll find it embarrassing and that's very fun for me, being embarrassed.

The argument for this method, `to_sort`, is an array of hashes that stores all of the posts.

Each hash looks like this:

    {
      :text=>"the body of the post (in markdown) would go here, but it would be long so I'm leaving it out",
      :title=>"Introducing myself to the command line",
      :date=>"2012-02-26",
      :time=>"12:00 PM",
      :category=>"coding",
      :tags_array=>["command-line", "learning"],
      :filename=>"2012-02-26-introducing-myself-to-the-command-line"
    }

And the method takes the info, specifically the date and time, and adds an additional parameter, `:sorter`, and then sorts the array based on that value of each hash, and returns the sorted array.

    def sort_posts (to_sort)
      to_sort.each do |post|
        the_date = post[:date]
        the_time = post[:time]
        if the_time =~ /AM|am/
          if the_time =~ /^[0-9]:/ # aka ONE digit before the colon
            sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ("0" + the_time).gsub(/:| |AM|am/,'')
          else
            sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + the_time.gsub(/:| |AM|am/,'')
          end
        end
        if the_time =~ /PM|pm/
          if the_time =~ /12:/
            sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ((the_time.gsub(/:| |PM|pm/,'')).to_i).to_s
          else
            if the_time =~ /^[0-9]:/ # aka ONE digit before the colon
              sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ((("0" + the_time).gsub(/:| |PM|pm/,'')).to_i + 1200).to_s
            else
              sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ((the_time.gsub(/:| |PM|pm/,'')).to_i + 1200).to_s
            end
          end
        end
        post[:sorter] = sorter.to_i
      end
      to_sort.sort! { |a,b| b[:sorter] <=> a[:sorter]}
      return to_sort
    end

So that's that.

**Edit (2012-12-02, 10:58 AM):** There's a bug in there! posts at 12:15am would sort newer than posts at 1:15am becuase twelve is a higher number than one. So I added some conditioanls to treat 12 like zero. Updated code below:

    def sort_posts (to_sort)
      to_sort.each do |post|
        the_date = post[:date]
        the_time = post[:time]
        if the_time =~ /AM|am/
          if the_time =~ /^[0-9]:/ # aka ONE digit before the colon
            sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ("0" + the_time).gsub(/:| |AM|am/,'')
          elsif the_time =~ /^12:/
            sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ("00" + the_time).gsub(/:| |AM|am|12/,'')
          else
            sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + the_time.gsub(/:| |AM|am/,'')
          end
        end
        if the_time =~ /PM|pm/
          if the_time =~ /12:/
            sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ((the_time.gsub(/:| |PM|pm/,'')).to_i).to_s
          else
            if the_time =~ /^[0-9]:/ # aka ONE digit before the colon
              sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ((("0" + the_time).gsub(/:| |PM|pm/,'')).to_i + 1200).to_s
            else
              sorter = the_date.gsub(/-/,'') + ((the_time.gsub(/:| |PM|pm/,'')).to_i + 1200).to_s
            end
          end
        end
        post[:sorter] = sorter.to_i
      end
      
      to_sort.sort! { |a,b| b[:sorter] <=> a[:sorter]}
    end

SEE?? Embarrassing. I love it. I'm sure there's an easier way to do this. But it's interesting, I think, that an idea ("hmm, i want to sort by both date and time, so why don't I make a `:sorter` variable that takes those two strings and combines them into one an integer that represents when it was posted") morphs and grows into this 28 line mess. I guess it's time to refactor.
