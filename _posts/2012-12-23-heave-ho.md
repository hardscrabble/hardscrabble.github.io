So I am happy enough with beefsteak that I am moving this to my proper homepage, <http://www.maxjacobson.net>.

That space was mainly occupied by my pinboard public links, and I've integrated those into beefsteak now.

I considered integrating a pinboard gem but for now I'm sticking with the same old linkroll widget I've been using. It's not super flexible but it has an important feature [the main pinboard gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/pinboard) lacks: a distinction between private and public links. It's not that I have such private stuff in there, it's just that I have *so much* stuff in there. As [previously described](http://www.maxjacobson.net/2012-08-26-favblogging) I use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) to send all kinds of stuff automatically, and then I occasionally make a small minority of those links public. And maybe there's some private stuff in there.

Who is sleepier than I? No one is.

The project is still mostly useable by other people, I think. The only thing is the small jquery script that modifies the DOM so that links with the tag `max_jacobson` are made red. I tweaked it so it lets you specify what that tag will be, but it's not working. I'm going to fix that later, *maybe*.

I create links just to kill them at this point. Old feeds and links have a short shelf life.
