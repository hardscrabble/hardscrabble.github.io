Since [my last post][], in which I announced version v0.4.0 of film snob and
kind of agonized over the decision to mark it as a minor release, I've gone
ahead and made two more minor releases. I have much less anxiety about it now.
In fact, I wish I had been doing that earlier.

[my last post]: /2014/film-snob-040/

I decided to do some release notes on the release section of the GitHub repo,
instead of here: <https://github.com/maxjacobson/film_snob/releases>.

While adding release notes for the very oldest versions, from April, I laughed
seeing how stuck I was on v0.3.x, not sure when I was allowed to move forward,
and just continuing to add these patch level releases for things that were
totally new functionality.

Here's what's new in v0.5.0:
<https://github.com/maxjacobson/film_snob/releases/tag/v0.5.0>.

And here's what's new in v0.6.0:
<https://github.com/maxjacobson/film_snob/releases/tag/v0.6.0>.

The next big thing I'll need to decide be when to mark the major release of
`v1.0.0`. I had [some ideas][ideas] about breaking changes that I would like to
make, so I thought I would save those for the first major release, but then a
very generous stranger implemented those ideas and made some pull requests, so I
have to decide if I'm ready to make it happen now. Why not, I guess? :fearful:
