If there's one piece of advice I feel comfortable giving, it's this: participate
in society. Find it in your introverted self to *join in*.

When you hear vaguely that you ought to be using zsh instead of bash, but when
you try it you're not sure why it's better, *stick with it*. When you hear that
oh-my-zsh is a good way to manage your zsh configuration and you think the name
is dumb and don't want to use it, *get over yourself*, because months later
you'll find yourself desperately googling to see if anyone else has is using
zsh in tmux on el capitan and experiencing a weird behavior where
option-backspace isn't working (it's supposed to delete backwards a full word),
but only when in tmux, and you can't really find anything, just throw out your
zsh configuration and use the thing that people use. You won't regret it.

Anyway, that's just my one piece of advice.
