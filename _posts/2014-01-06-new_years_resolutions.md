Last year was good. I think I resolved to take programming seriously. I went to The Flatiron School and now I'm working at CipherHealth. I've learned a shit load and had a lot of fun.

## Things I want to learn in 2014

* Objective-C / iOS programming
* Ember.js
* Node.js
* What the fuck a javascript promise is
* How the hell source maps work
* BASIC MUSIC PLAYING
* How the health care industry works
* VimScript

## Things I want to make in 2014

* A [Fountain](http://fountain.io) parser in Ruby (WIP [maxjacobson/smashcut](https://github.com/maxjacobson/smashcut))
* A country-guessing game (WIP [maxjacobson/mapquest](https://github.com/maxjacobson/mapquest/))
* A contribution to [prawnpdf/prawn](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn)

## Things I want to do in 2014

* Move back to NYC
* Write a god damn poem

## Things I want to read (in 2014)

* Less Twitter
* Infinite Jest I guess?
