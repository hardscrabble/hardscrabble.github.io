I so love to read [Giri Nathan's tennis columns over at Defector](https://defector.com/author/giri-nathan), and his post today about Andy Murray is typically excellent: <https://defector.com/andy-murray-sacrifices-his-body-and-sleep-to-deliver-another-classic-win>

> It's captivating to watch this man spit, scrape, and grimace his way through these victories, as if he'd laid out in advance the most miserable possible task for himself and then slogged through it as punishment.

The first clip embedded in that post had my jaw on the floor.

I slept through more than five hours of this match but was glad to catch the end of it.
