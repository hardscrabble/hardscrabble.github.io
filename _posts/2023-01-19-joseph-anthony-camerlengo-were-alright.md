It could be that it's 5:35 and I'm up late watching tennis and half asleep but I adore this performance of "We're Alright" by Joseph Anthony Camerlengo from 2012:

It's jolted me back awake.

The [album version of the track](https://josephanthonycamerlengo.bandcamp.com/track/were-alright) is way, way shorter and comparatively restrained.

But lyrics like these ("I'm afraid I haven't sang it enough, but I love you") deserve to be repeated and screamed until the sound gives out.
