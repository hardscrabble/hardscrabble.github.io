This blog is open for business. Also it's open like, it's on [on github](https://github.com/maxjacobson/maxjacobson.github.io), which means you can fork it, read the drafts, submit pull requests, etc.

This isn't a big deal. It's true of all jekyll blogs on github. While reading about "open companies" like [Balanced][] and [Gittip][], I thought that this is also true of my blog.

I kind of want to be a better blogger. I'm pretty proud of how I put together this new blog. It feels sturdy, with well-organized source code.

Today I bought a hoodie at American Apparel and the guy ringing me up asked for my email address because "we're kind of going green and sending by receipts via email" and I told him it's <max@hardscrabble.net> and he asked me to spell it. I said, "it's max at hard, like difficult, and scrabble, like the game" and the other cashier laughed like, what kind of email address is that? I said, "I just think it's a fun word" and got the hell out of there.
