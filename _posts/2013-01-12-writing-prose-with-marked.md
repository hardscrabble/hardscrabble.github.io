Yesterday I got the urge to write some fiction. This has been a decreasingly frequent urge for me, so I seized on it.

I did write a little but I ended up spending more time creating a [Marked](http://markedapp.com) theme to *help* me write. Ain't that how it goes. I set up [a GitHub repo][] to share the theme and any others I may make down the line.

[a GitHub repo]: https://github.com/maxjacobson/marked-themes

The goal is for me to be able to write in my programmy, vimmy text editor on one half of the screen and for the other half to look as much like a book as I could manage. Also, it prints out nicely (not that I print things, except to PDF). Some of the design features:

* smart paragraph indenting -- follows the physical book's convention of not unnecessarily indenting the first paragraph in a group of paragraphs
* kind of musty old book yellow color (but not in printouts)
* uses google web fonts for a little extra personality
* classy horizontal rule

A screenshot and the code over [on GitHub][].
