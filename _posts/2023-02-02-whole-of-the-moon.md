Check out this cover of Whole of the Moon by Fiona Apple:

(I particularly like when the wandering camera lingers on her boot, stomping to the beat)

I wasn't familiar with the [original song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBW8Vnp8BzU) by The Waterboys from 1985 (I never even heard of The Waterboys). 

> I wandered out in the world for years
>
> While you just stayed in your room
>
> I saw the crescent
>
> But you saw the whole of the moon

This reminds me of that Pinegrove song with a very similar title, Size of the Moon:

{% include youtube.html id="kdFK1qtlzZk" %}

That one has these lines:

> I got caught
>
> you got those caravaggio moves
>
> We had some good ideas but we never left that fucking room

And later:

> I remember that too
>
> In your living room, right?
>
> When we began to fight but then we both got confused
>
> Then we were laughing & crying in awe of the size of the moon

In both songs we're comparing ourselves to others, we're trapped in rooms, we're thinking about the moon.

I love when songs are in conversation with each other and I didn't even know it.
Finally hearing that other part of the conversation after only hearing one side for a while expands something about both.

Something about being in a room when the moon is up there is profane, maybe?
