This a capella performance from 2008 is gorgeous.
Their more recent stuff seems much more complicated but it's nice to see this organic stuff working like gangbusters.

See also [Flume on acoustic guitar and toy piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvvQQHnpRfA) and [Skinny Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLOr_FrJJWA) in a living room of beaming smiles.

I used to love these Blogoth√©que videos.
They're [still making them](https://www.youtube.com/@blogotheque/videos)!
Amazing.
