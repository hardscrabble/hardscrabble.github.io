Today I'm happy to release film snob v0.4.0.

I first wrote about film snob [in April][], when I extracted it from my old web
app [Layabout][].

[in April]: /2014/refactoring-old-code/
[Layabout]: http://layabout.tv

None of the changes add new functionality, so maybe it was wrong to call this a
minor release. They also don't fix any bugs. [They're all][] to do with making
small stylistic changes that make the code easier to read or more consistent. I
haven't been releasing those changes because I haven't been sure what the point
is -- why release an update that doesn't change anything?

[They're all]: https://github.com/maxjacobson/film_snob/compare/v0.3.13...v0.4.0

If someone is using film snob, and it's not behaving how they expect, they might
check the source code to help them understand and debug their problem. With that
scenario in mind, I definitely want to release these changes.

Also, today I merged [an awesome pull request][] which renames a method and
emits a deprecation warning for the old method name. Thanks to [Wil Chandler][]
for making that change.

Ever since [Anton Davydov][] [added][instagram] support for embedding photos and
videos from Instagram, it's been kind of weird that one of the main public
interfaces for film snob has been the `watchable?` method. Instagram photos
aren't really watchable, right? They're look-at-able, I suppose, but not
watchable. Soon we'll be adding support for embedding Rdio playlists & songs
too, and it'll be even more semantically unsettling.

The experience now looks something like this:

```
15:22:33 tralfamadore-5 hardscrabble.net:master
⇥ irb
>> require 'film_snob'
=> true
>> FilmSnob.new('http://instagram.com/p/sw4RThIctq/').watchable?
WARNING: #watchable? is deprecated and will be removed in v1.0.0. Please use #embeddable? instead.
=> true
>> FilmSnob.new('http://instagram.com/p/sw4RThIctq/').embeddable?
=> true
```

Embeddable feels more right to me.

So even though there's no new functionality, there is more clarity, and maybe
clarity counts as a feature? 🍃
