This Tiny Desk Concert performance by Daniel Johnston from 2012 really moved me, particularly the fourth and final song, True Love Will Find You In the End.

It has to do, in part, with the impression that Johnston, at 51, is not particularly well.
He would die seven years later of a heart attack.
He's singing about how he feels like a mummy, or Dracula, or Mr. Hyde, or a ghost.
But he's not alone up there.
He has a friend and an audience that loves him.
When he sings about optimism it feels hard-earned and true.
