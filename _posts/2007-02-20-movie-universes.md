It occurs to me that movie story telling has a hole in it. In The Matador, when Julian (played by Pierce *Brosnan*) is flirting with Genevive, the receptionist at the airline, why doesn't she go, "Oh my God, you're Pierce Brosnan! I saw all the Bond movies you were in, I'm your biggest fan!"?

Movies can't exist in the universes that movie-stories occur in, or at the very least, the ones that share actors. In the Matador, James Bond doesn't exist, can't exist.

I don't like that.
