I've always loved this Taylor Swift performance of Riptide from 2014.

The [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ_1HMAGb4k) is quite corny and insincere, IMHO, but the words feel potent in Swift's voice.
In part this is because she didn't touch any of the pronouns, and doesn't shy away from lyrics like "I wanna be your left-hand man", which brings to mind the [Gaylor](https://www.gawker.com/celebrity/is-taylor-swift-gay-gaylor-tiktok) conspiracy theory.
