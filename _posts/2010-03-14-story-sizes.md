If movies are kind of like short stories, and television series are kind of like novels, what's the analog for short films?

I'm thinking flash fiction. How does that hold up? Pretty well I think. Some are quicker flashes than others. Some balloon up to short story status.

Is this a helpful way of thinking about it?

I liked posting shorts this past week. I have to watch some more to keep this ongoing... It'll be less often probably. Hope you're enjoying these too.
