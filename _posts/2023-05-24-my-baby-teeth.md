Wye Oak's Civilian is one of my favorite songs.

{% include youtube.html id="DVaeAu_noFM" %}

There's a cinematic, epic  yearning here, and it's no surprise it's been [used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_(Wye_Oak_album)#In_popular_culture) in a ton of movies and TV shows.

> When most of them I can barely keep up with them

> I'm perfectly able to hold my own hand

> But I still can't kiss my own neck


[The studio version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU-BcwG8dfM) benefits from a driving drum beat and a ripping guitar solo to help build up its intensity, but this acoustic rendition doesn't need them.

Jenn Wasner is the coolest.
Outside of her work in Wye Oak, she's also toured with Bon Iver and contributed to their most recent album [I, I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_I).
