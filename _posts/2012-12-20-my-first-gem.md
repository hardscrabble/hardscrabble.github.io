One of the projects I've been intermittently working on is called smashcut. I've been keeping it sort of vague and secret because I'm imagining tickling a wild beast of an audience that isn't *necessarily* real and that tickles me.

I'm planning to release it as a gem soon enough. I've just learned how to do that and it was shockingly easy. A real delight. It's even quite easy for the gem to be a command line tool. I am using it locally by running smashcut and it is doing things. I am thrilled.

I learned this from the first google result for the query "how to make a gem" (<http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/>) which I'm sure you could just as easily have found.

I need to learn more about testing and also sleep more.
