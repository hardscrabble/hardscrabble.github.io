In my Psychology class today we talked about Pavlov's dogs, the ones that were conditioned to start drooling at the sound of a bell, because they were trained to associate it with food.

It started to get redundant and my mind wandered and a song got stuck in my head. Before I knew it, I was wondering whether or not songs "growing on me" counts as conditioning. If I don't like something on first listen, but on repeat listens it seems to open up to me, despite the fact I'm hearing the exact same thing, am I forcibly training my brain to accept it, or am I noticing small details that make the song for me?

Psychology is making me paranoid.
