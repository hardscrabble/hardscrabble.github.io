From a few weeks ago:

I had no idea what he meant. But I should have, because he was making a reference to an essay I had shared with him and which we had then discussed called [Fish][]. In the essay, Robin Sloan suggests, among other things, the value of revisiting things we like over constantly checking what's new. I hadn't meant to reference it and hadn't thought much about it since reading it, but that idea must have kept with me.

Earlier tonight I watched this video three times:

Do you know that feeling of going to a concert for a band you love, where none of your friends like that band, and you sort of feel like a weirdo for liking them, only to discover that tons of other people like them too and you're fine? That's the feeling I got while watching this video, and I didn't even need to leave the house to get it.
