Something occurred to me while I was brushing my teeth tonight: Lost would make a pretty dumb movie. If I saw the trailer for it, I'd probably pass, because grand mysteries feel less relevant when they're opened and shut in the course of one night. With Lost, I've been wondering for _years_ now what the hell is going on, and I still care and I still don't know. Honestly, I don't think I ever want to know what's going on, because the pleasure I get from it comes from wondering, not from finding out. The creators have struck on something incredibly addicting but put themselves in a really difficult position, because they're playing jenga with this show.
