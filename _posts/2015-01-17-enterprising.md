Steven Soderbergh re-edited some famous movies. Jason Kottke [linked to them][0]
and, among other things, mentioned this (emphasis mine):

[0]: http://kottke.org/15/01/soderberghs-edit-of-2001

> I've seen some comments on Twitter and elsewhere about the legality of
Soderbergh posting the 2001 and Raiders edits. The videos are hosted on Vimeo,
but are private and can't be embedded on any site other than Soderbergh's. But
**any enterprising person can easily figure out how to download either video**.
The Raiders video has been up since September, which means either that
Paramount doesn't care (most likely in my mind) or their lawyers somehow
haven't caught wind of it, even though it was all over the internet a few
months ago (less likely). We'll see if whoever owns the rights to 2001 (Time
Warner?) feels similarly.

I read that and was kind of surprised because at first blush I had absolutely
no clue at all how I might download the video. Sooooo I had to try:

{% include vimeo.html id="117056934" %}
