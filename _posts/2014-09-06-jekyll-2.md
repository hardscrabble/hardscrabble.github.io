I [just finished](https://github.com/hardscrabble/hardscrabble.github.io/pull/19) updating my blog to Jekyll 2.0. It looks the same, but the code is nicer.[^qualifier]

[^qualifier]: The diff says I deleted 3623 lines, but it's not as amazing as that sounds because 3263 of them are from a CSS library that I realized I don't use anymore.

The marquee feature is that Jekyll now knows how to compile Sass and CoffeeScript. I was already using those languages, but relying on a [complex Guardfile](https://github.com/hardscrabble/hardscrabble.github.io/blob/ad915235d6875074d435f2609b562cb7252b9fab/Guardfile) to accomplish it. I'm pleased to delete that.

Like all files Jekyll processes, Sass and CoffeeScript files [must have YAML at the top of them](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/), though no YAML data is actually required to be there, just the hyphens where the YAML would go. That's an awkward requirement which I hope goes away.

The other thing I got to delete was some boilerplate configuration in the head of every page and post, in which I would tell Jekyll that posts should use the post layout and pages should use the page layout, so it knows which layout to use. Now I just tell it which layout to use for posts and which to use for pages once in the global configuration file, which is much nicer.

The last new thing I want to explore is using GitHub-style code blocks. I'd prefer to use the triple backtick over the liquid tag. This [is supposed to be possible](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#markdown-options) but I couldn't get it to work perfectly -- code blocks were generated, but lost the syntax highlighting so I decided to leave it for now.

The creator of Jekyll, GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner, recently [left GitHub](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/github-founder-resigns-after-investigation/) after being investigated about very unprofessional behavior. Four months earlier, the Jekyll project was distanced from him a bit when the source code [was moved](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/1817) from his personal account to [an organization account](https://github.com/jekyll) dedicated to Jekyll and related projects. This is normal and reflects that the project outgrew him, and that he's not the main maintainer anymore. When Jekyll 2.0.0 [was released](http://jekyllrb.com/news/2014/05/06/jekyll-turns-2-0-0/), Preston-Werner's name was buried in a wall of thank-yous.

I feel slightly weird using Jekyll because of who created it. I'm glad it doesn't follow the naming pattern of [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) and [tomdoc](http://tomdoc.org/) at least.
