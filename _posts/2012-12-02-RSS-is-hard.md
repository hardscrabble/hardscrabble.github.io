I'm pretty sure I'm not doing this right but I've added an RSS feed so that's fun, enjoy.

It's available at [/feed](/feed.xml) and ever time that "file" is queried, the sinatra app will generate an up-to-the-minute accurate feed, including all of the posts.

I don't necessarily recommend subscribing because I might change where it's located soon. Right now the blog is online at `http://devblog.maxjacobson.net` but I may move it to `blog.` or `beef.` or `beefsteak.` or something else entirely.
