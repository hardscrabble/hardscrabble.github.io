God bless the YouTube algorithm for surfacing this video to me because I've been wondering how the hell they do this for years.

{% include youtube.html id="VASwKZAUVSo" %}

For me, the more interesting question isn't "how" do they do this (although I am very interested in that!) but also... why?

I can see an argument that it's more immersive, but for me it's a common uncanny valley, where I just find myself struck by the clever artifice of how it was constructed instead of paying attention to the characters or story.
