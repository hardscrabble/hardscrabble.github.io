title: Synchronize Our Dictionaries

Recently I've been melting the butter stick of my brain against the griddle of Reginald Braithwaite, whose twin books on JavaScript and CoffeeScript as functional programming languages, *JavaScript Allonge* and *CoffeeScript Ristretto* have been tripping me out hard.

I bought them yesterday for their Black Friday half-off prices and loaded them into iBooks on my Mac and iPad (so glad to have a good ePub reader for Mac) after having their full-text-for-free web pages open for weeks in my browser, teasing me to read them while I do Ruby stuff all day.

> In order to talk about how this works, we should agree on a few terms (you may already know them, but let's check-in together and "synchronize our dictionaries"). The first `x`, the one in `(x) ->`, is an *argument*. The `y` in `(y) ->` is another argument. The second `x`, the one in `-> x`, is not an argument, it's *an expression referring to a variable*. Arguments and variables work the same way whether we're talking about `(x) -> (y) -> x` or just plain `(x) -> x`.

The particulars of this passage aren't as important as that one phrase I plucked as the title of the blog post which I just really like a lot. Any kind of writing is basically just that. It's as much about synchronizing your minds as it is synchronizing your language but that's kind of the same thing.
