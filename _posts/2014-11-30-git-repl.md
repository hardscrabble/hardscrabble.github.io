The other day [I mentioned][] coming upon a neat set of git extensions called
'git extras' by TJ Holowaychuk. Since then I've become slightly obsessed with
it. It's so useful, including as a terrific learning tool. Take 'git repl' as an
example.

[I mentioned]: /2014/git-fresh-branch/

First of all, what is it?

allow me to answer with a GIF:

**In short:** if you're gonna be doing a bunch of git operations in a row, why
keep typing `git` over and over when you can go into a git repl and just let it
assume that everything you're doing is going to be a git command?

It plays well with vim, too -- the commit message editor seamlessly pops into
vim and then back into the git repl on quit.

So how does it work? I looked at it and assumed that it must be *so much code*
and way beyond my understanding. But that's totally wrong! It's just [43 lines
of bash][] and it's fairly readable.

The really interesting part is `read`, which has a comment indicating that it's
powered by `Readline`, which is one of those words that I've seen fly around
while existing in the world of software, but have never heard defined. Well,
here's the wikipedia page for it: [GNU Readline][]. It was originally written
by Brian Fox, who also created bash. Ruby's various REPLs (eg rails console,
irb, pry) are probably using it under the hood via Ruby's [standard Readline
library](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.5/libdoc/readline/rdoc/Readline.html),
which makes writing a REPL super simple, while maintaining the behaviors you may
be used to. For example, I compulsively press control+l to clear the screen;
this works in a readline REPL but not in something like this:

```ruby
loop do
  print "> "
  input = gets.chomp
  puts input
end
```

Filename tab completion works as well! Whoa!

Here's my first readline program, inspired by the git repl code:

```bash
function extensions {
  read -e -r -p "find files with extension: " extension
  find . -name "*.$extension"
}
```

Try pasting that into your terminal then entering `extensions` to run it and to
explore your projects. It should prompt you for a file extension (try entering
`rb` in a Ruby project, for example) and then spit out the list of files with
that extension in the current directory (and its subdirectories).

Not a particularly great program! I'm mostly just happy to see how simple and
demonstrative the git extras code was.
