This sketch from last night's SNL made me laugh out loud:

It features host Quinta Brunson from Abbott Elementary and I don't really want to describe it except to say it's very funny and features quite a lot of shouting.
Enjoy.

It seems like road rage may be in the zeitgeist.
I'm very much looking forward to [Beef](https://youtu.be/AFPIMHBzGDs), the new Netflix show starring Steven Yeun and Ali Wong about a traffic altercation that spirals out of control.
