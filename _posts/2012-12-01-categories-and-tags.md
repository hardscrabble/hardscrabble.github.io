I added some functionality for categories and tags. The difference between categories and tags, in my implementation, is that there can only be one category, but there can be a bunch of tags.

So be generous with your tags.

You can use spaces in your categories and tags and they'll be converted to hyphens. They're comma-delimited.

You can see the tags at the bottom of this post and you'll see some hyphens. but if you look at the markdown source, you'll see some spaces.

(You can see the markdown source by clicking the link at the bottom of each post or by simply replacing the `/` with `.md` at the end of a post url)
