You may or may not be familiar with [REJECTED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejected), the classic animated short film by living genius Don Hertzfeldt.
If not, [go watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7JyjZI3LUM) and let it burn itself into your brain and make you laugh very hard every time you rewatch it for the rest of your life.
Then seek out his longer works like [It's such a beautiful day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Such_a_Beautiful_Day_(film)) and [World of Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PUIxEWmsvI) which are much more serious while still being deeply silly...

For everyone else...

Hertzfeldt did a very funny "text commentary" version, which I just stumbled on.
Here it is:

I learned a lot, but also laughed a lot.
It's so dumb lmao.

Enjoy!
