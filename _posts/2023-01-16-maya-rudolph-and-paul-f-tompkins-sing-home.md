I bookmarked this video on [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) about ten years ago.
I don't remember doing that, or what the context was.
I like to think it was just a little seed I planted for myself because I knew it would make me smile one day.

And it did!

This is one of those songs where the covers are better than the original.
See also [this charming father daughter cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L64c5vT3NBw) that I haven't seen in even longer but stuck in some recess of my brain.

I'm planning to shut down my pinboard account.
I had spurts where I shoved links in there, but I never actually looked at it that much.
Some of those are becoming blog posts.
A ton of the links are now broken.
The shelf life of the internet is not that long.
