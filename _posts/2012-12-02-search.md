I'm not sure but I think I just implemented search like it was no big deal.

It works well and fast but only because there are so few posts, I assume. I'm not searching the whole internet here or anything, but I do kinda feel like **I Am Google** or something.

That's a theme for this system: it will get worse the more I use it. I'm kinda excited to ruin it.
