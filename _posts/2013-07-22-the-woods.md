A few months ago I saw a newish movie called ["The Kings of Summer"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLnAiVI4R2Q), which is about a trio of teenage boys who get fed up with their loving parents, move into the woods, build a ramshackle house, and live in it. They're trying to make a statement. I think it's something like, "**We're men**. Stop treating us like kids; we can live off the land."

## programmers, drawn to the woods

As I've been learning to program within the Ruby on Rails web application framework I've, at times, felt like those kids suffocated by their loving parents:

And drawn to that ugly pile of sticks in that clearing in the woods. Not because it's better, but because it's *more mine*.

I'm drawn to the woods when I read [blog posts like this](http://words.steveklabnik.com/returning-to-free-software-a-guide) and want to replace OS X with Linux and Sublime Text 2 with Vim.

I was drawn to the woods when I got [this eyebrow-raising keyboard](http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=leopold,tenkeyless&pid=fc200rrawn) I type fast as hell on.

I'm drawn to the woods when I read about Node JS even though I'm in the middle of a program learning Rails.

*Summer* is a pretty good movie. I like the way it pokes fun at these kids' na√Øve concept of what it means to be an adult. At one point the protagonist is proud to grow a mustache. But in the end, they go home to their parents, and it's the **most grown-up thing they do all movie**.

I'm slowly coming around to the Rails idea of "convention over configuration". Not that I was opposed to it or anything, but I didn't immediately appreciate or understand it. Learning and using Rails still feels a little like moving into a fully-furnished apartment where the previous tenant and I wouldn't have *necessarily* hung out. But it's got AC and a well-stocked fridge and who am I to complain?

Going to the woods is fine. You might find and bring something amazing back with you, like Rails or *For Emma, Forever Ago*. I really don't mean to bolster any societal hegemony. Just try not to get lost.
