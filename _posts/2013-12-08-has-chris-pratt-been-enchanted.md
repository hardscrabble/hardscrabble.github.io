I can't think of Chris Pratt, the very funny actor who plays Andy on *Parks and Rec*, without thinking about this tweet, by that show's creator, Mike Schur:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>If <a href="https://twitter.com/prattprattpratt">@prattprattpratt</a> were a stock, he&#39;d be Apple in 2002.</p>&mdash; Ken Tremendous (@KenTremendous) <a href="https://twitter.com/KenTremendous/statuses/298898520969207808">February 5, 2013</a></blockquote>

This tweet accompanied the news that Pratt was cast in the lead role of Marvel's upcoming, probably huge superhero movie [*Guardians of the Galaxy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_%28film%29). Obviously Schur has some bias, being friends and colleagues with the guy, but I can't help but agree. I think Chris Pratt has been enchanted.

Andy wasn't supposed to be a regular on *Parks and Rec* but they kept him.

He's like, really funny on Twitter.

He's married to Anna Farris and they seem really happy.

He apparently has [no][] [trouble][] losing weight and becoming muscular in a cinematic way.

No like, really, Hollywood is happy to cast him as the funny guy, one of the guys in Oscar-bait like *Zero Dark Thirty*.

Who is Chris Pratt? There seems to be no undercurrent of anxiety like drives some artists, he's too busy soliciting his fans to tell him the best moment in their life, and dishing out positive affirmations:

His simple positivity almost reminds me of artists like [Steve Roggenbuck](http://gawker.com/something-about-how-steve-roggenbucks-poetry-will-save-1456424675) or [Ryland Maserang](https://twitter.com/avocadoe) without the poetry?

He's charming, politically neutral, and probably, I think, enchanted. I'd buy that stock.
