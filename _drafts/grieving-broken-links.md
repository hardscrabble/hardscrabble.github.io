It's sad when links break.

For many years, I've used [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) to bookmark interesting links.
I've recently been perusing those bookmarks, and so so many of them are now broken links, and it's making me sad.
Sometimes the whole site is gone and other times the site is up but the post or video was deleted.

In some cases, I can pull up the old version of the page on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) but not always.
Videos, for example, aren't archived as far as I know.

It occurs to me that I am part of the problem.
Last month, in reaction to the ["Extremely Hardcore"](https://nymag.com/press/2023/01/extremely-hardcore-inside-twitter-under-elon-musk.html) takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk, I made my twitter account private and stopped posting.
In so doing, all links to my tweets are now broken (unless you already follow me).

I'm sorry!

I actually want to link to one of my own tweets... 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I hope YouTube is around for another ten years and this video, a cover of Dire Straits's Romeo and Juliet, which I vaguely recall stumbling on and loving 10 years ago, seems even blurrier then. And I hope tweets are even longer and I share it again <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMnDzN1mIjE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMnDzN1mIjE</a>
</p>&mdash; Max Jacobson (@maxjacobson) <a href="https://twitter.com/maxjacobson/status/1015750229470138368">July 7, 2018</a></blockquote>

(Part of the context of that tweet was that twitter had [recently](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16363912/twitter-character-limit-increase-280-test) increased the maximum length of tweets from 140 to 280 characters)

Here's what I see when I visit that YouTube URL now:

It doesn't even tell me the name of the account, which I've now forgotten.

It's easy to let this pile of micro regrets accumulate.
Maybe I could have included the name of the musician in the tweet.
Maybe I could have [downloaded](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) a copy of the video.
But where would I have put it?

Maybe it's okay and natural for some things to go.

Although...

Here's a screenshot from a Wayback Machine [snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20150107042428/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMnDzN1mIjE) from January 2015:

I can see that the musician is named [Dan Hardin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCMqEBZ2MtfoQX_bUwwi2Pw)!
Seems like all of his videos have been unpublished.
And in fact he has an explanation:

> I took down all my videos because YouTube is putting advertisements on them without my consent or compensation.  Maybe someday a more suitable platform will exist and I'll try posting there.

Wow...

Now I'm finding all of his links...

Well... all right, those are some threads to pull on.

I've just backed his patreon for $5/mo and I'll shoot him a message asking about that recording.

Just doing my part to rage, rage against the dying of the light...
