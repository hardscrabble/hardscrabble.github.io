Here's how I stay on top of my work email.
We use Gmail at work, so I use [Mimestream], a very nice Gmail Mac app, to read and write email.

I do try to do "Inbox Zero".

To get emails out of my inbox, I do a handful of things:

- archive it by pressing the backspace button
- star and archive it by pressing `s` and then the backspace button -- this means there's something I need to do about this email
- add the "read later" label and archive it -- this means I don't need to do anything but it seems kind of interesting and I'll check it out some time when I'm bored
- add the "bookmarked" label and archive it -- this means I might need or want to reference it at some point, perhaps for some nostalgic or logistical reason

Then the starred emails are kind of like a to do list.
The next step is to go thru the starred emails, figure out what I need to do about them, and remove the star.

Right now there's 20ish starred emails in there.

Note: this workflow is largely inspired by [this blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609070116/https://xph.us/2013/01/22/inbox-zero-for-life.html).
