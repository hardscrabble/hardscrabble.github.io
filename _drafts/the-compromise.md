Here's something different: I made a short film. It's called The Compromise. I'd love if you took a look:

Thanks to everyone who helped make this possible:

I used to make short films and [put them on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/maxjacobson).
A bunch of them are plotless doodles, just little moments that caught my eye cut together.
The ones with plots aren't much easier to follow.
It's for the best that I set my camcorder down and learned to code instead.

But.

I recently accepted a job to go work for Vimeo as a software engineer helping to build [Vimeo OTT].
I took a week off between the two jobs.
I was planning to mostly relax and try to "reset" my mind a little so that I could feel rested and forward-looking.
Instead, I did this.
This isn't actually relevant to the work I'll be doing at Vimeo.
Like, at all.
But I couldn't help it.
My life after college took this weird sharp left into tech, and by going to work for Vimeo, I feel like that path is snapping into place.
I rode the [health care patient engagement software highway][ch], took the [static analysis ferry][quality] to the [engineering intelligence island][velocity], but I've found my way back to where I was going 9 years ago.

And if that's true, then I should make a movie.

I had recently listened to [John August talk about Highland][dialog], his screenwriting app.
I had actually eagerly followed the early development of Fountain, the markdown-like plaintext syntax for screenplays that underpins Highland.
I even attempted to write my own fountain-to-pdf converter in Ruby, which was a boondoggle of a first coding project, but got me started on the path to coding.

So I bought that and started writing.
Full circle.

This was Friday, August 30th, 2019.
About 8 hours after leaving my last day of work.
About 8 years since I last tried to write a screenplay.

While walking to work a few weeks earlier, I had an idea for a short story, which I jotted down in my Omnifocus, which is a rat's nest of ideas and obligations.
I dredged it up and thought about whether it could be adapted to a short film that I might film quickly and with minimal preparation.
Here's what it said:

> short story “brute force” about someone actually waiting 40 years for a brute force algorithm to crack a phone, and the new society doesn’t end up caring maybe, but something hugely important. alternate title: “the compromise”

That was all that I had.
I jotted that down and then forgot about it.
