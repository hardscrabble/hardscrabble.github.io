> We are not "breaking up", because we all still love each other. Mary Lynn writes great music. I still write music all over. We all still exist and we all still create. We are simply putting a lid on This Is My Suitcase to capture everything we've done; We are merely writing a really good ending to our own wild story.

I don't remember where I first heard of This Is My Suitcase, but I think it was on the absolute punk forums, probably in some thread about links to `zip`s of weird albums from bands no one has heard of, many of which I downloaded and sifted through and deleted. One of them was "Missent to Thailand". I have a vague memory of listening to it in an airport and being shocked by how much I liked this weird out of tune pop about being in love.
