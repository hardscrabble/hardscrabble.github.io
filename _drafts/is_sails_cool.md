My wispy understanding of Node.js is that most web apps use Express.js but what about Sails.js? Being familiar with Rails, maybe I'm well primed to understand Sails.

Further: being familiar with Railscasts, maybe I'm inclined to enjoy Sailscasts?

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');
console.log(fs);
{% endhighlight %}
