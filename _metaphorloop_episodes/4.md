In the fourth episode of metaphor loop, I'm joined by [Meredith
Edwards][twitter], software engineer at [Stride]. We talked, as usual, about
teaching and learning. We also dug into how work environments can foster a
culture of learning and how tech hiring processes can find candidates who value
things like other people's opinions and communication skills.

Two behind the scenes notes about this episode:

1. We recorded this on one microphone, and so you'll hear us handing the mic
   back and forth, when I haven't been able to cleanly edit that out. Please
   don't be startled or alarmed. One thing that was kind of fun about this is
   that it made it a lot harder for me to interrupt, which is honestly probably
   for the best, given that mostly when I do it's to insert some dumb joke, but
   that might throw people off the point they're trying to make.
2. We recorded this a while ago (July 23rd, 2017) but I'm only releasing it now
   due to inefficiencies in the editing pipeline (which is me).

This week, the opening and closing music comes from Good Shade's CC-licensed
album [Lunch](http://www.quoteunquoterecords.com/qur096.htm). We open with
"Dearth" and close with "Styrofoam". I dig it.
