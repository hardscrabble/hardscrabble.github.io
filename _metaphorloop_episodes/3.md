In the third episode of metaphor loop, I'm joined by [Dan Eisenberg][twitter].
We dig into his perspective as an experienced programmer (he's worked at Google
and Flatiron Health), and the existential crises that come along with that.

This was supposed to come out last month but I got a little overwhelmed with
some life stuff and didn't make time to edit it. Apologies!

Fun note: I edited this one on my iPad Mini using an app called [Ferrite][]. I
did a little post-processing to make it louder in Audacity on my Mac, but all
editing before that (streamlining a few things and adding the intro and outro)
were done on the iPad.

This week, the opening and closing music comes from Diner's CC-licensed EP
[IT'S ALL TRUE](http://www.quoteunquoterecords.com/qur082.htm). We open with
"My House" and close with "Really Wanna Know". I dig it.
