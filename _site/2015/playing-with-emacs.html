    <p>Today I’m playing with emacs. There has been a confluence of events which have led me to this moment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, the other night I bumped into Harry Schwartz at a programming meetup, and he gave me <a href="http://harryrschwartz.com/2015/02/18/emacsnyc-stickers.html">a sticker</a> from his meetup group, <a href="http://emacsnyc.org/">New York Emacs</a>. I put it in my wallet.</li>
  <li>Second, yesterday I bumped into <a href="https://github.com/a-leung">Andrew Leung</a>, and somehow we got to talking about Emacs. He’s been using it for many, many years. I gave him the sticker from my wallet because I thought he would have more use for it than I would.</li>
  <li>Today I’m kind of bored.</li>
</ol>

<p>To my non-surprise, the version of Emacs which came installed on my Mac is a few major versions behind. To my surprise, the version of emacs on Homebrew is also a bit old. Neither version has syntax highlighting for Ruby, which was provided by default in the newest version. Installing the newer version wasn’t that bad. I downloaded the code from <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/">their ftp server</a> (emacs-24.4.tar.gz), unarchived it, and followed the instructions in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">INSTALL</code> file. Then, sweet, ruby files were colorful. That makes a huge difference for me.</p>

<p>I really don’t know what I’m doing, but I feel like I should learn more about emacs if I’m going to recommend people learn Vim, which I generally use and recommend, so today I took a little while to play with it and I’ve learned enough to do the super basic things. Here’s everything I know how to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">emacs .</code> from the command line to open emacs in a file browser</li>
  <li>arrow keys and return to browse and open files</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-x C-s</code> to save</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-x C-f &lt;enter&gt;</code> to return to the file browser from a file</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-a</code> to go to the beginning of a line</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-e</code> to go to the end of a line</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-n</code> to go to the next line</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-p</code> to go to the previous line</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-_</code> to undo a change</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-s</code> to search within a file</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">C-x C-c</code> to quit (it prompts you to save any unsaved changes at this point)</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note:</p>

<p>something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-x</code> can be read as <strong>“press the control key, and then press the x key while still holding down the control key”</strong></p>

<p>something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">C-x C-f</code> can be read as <strong>“press the control key, and then press the x key while still holding down the control key; then keep holding down the control key, and press the f key, and then feel free to go get a coffee, you’re done”</strong>)</p>

<p>And that’s it. Things I’d like to learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More commands to navigate the text within a file (deleting lines, copying, cutting, pasting)</li>
  <li>How to do some simple configuration (I want line numbers)</li>
  <li>How to more efficiently open files (I want a fuzzy file opener like <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp.vim</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s really all that’s blocking me from actually using it to do work. I’m using it to write this post, and I’m totally surviving.</p>

<p>If I were to go down the rabbit hole, I’d probably want to learn the whole Emacs Lisp thing. Richard Stallman, the creator of Emacs, <a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">says</a> this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most powerful programming language is Lisp. If you don’t know Lisp (or its variant, Scheme), you don’t know what it means for a programming language to be powerful and elegant. Once you learn Lisp, you will understand what is lacking in most other languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to read that and not get some programming FOMO.</p>

<p>I attended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z-YBsd5snY">this talk</a> from Harry called “An Introduction to Emacs Lisp”, which I may need to rewatch.</p>
