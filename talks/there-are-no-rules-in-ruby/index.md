Hi!

This is currently a sorta secret page, which means either that:

1. You lurked on my GitHub activity and saw that I pushed this up (:wave:)
1. I forgot to update this text before doing the talk at RubyConf, and then you
   diligently followed the link. Thanks!
1. Well, OK, maybe I sent you this to get some early feedback on the slides
   before the conference, that's also totally possible.

Some links:

* [Slides](/talks/there-are-no-rules-in-ruby/slides)
* Video (tktk)
