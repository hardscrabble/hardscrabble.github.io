  <div class="body">
    <p>In <a href="http://www.hardscrabble.net/2015/building-firefox/">Wednesday’s post about building Firefox from source the other day</a>, I
mentioned one thing I really liked about the experience of first looking at this
code base: it kept dropping little hints about what I might need to do next in a
way that was actually insightful and helpful. For example, after running their
script which installs dependencies, there was some helpful output pointing me to
where I could get the code base.</p>

<p>Today I checked in with the project and pulled the change from the last few
days. There has been a flurry of activity, none of which means much of anything
to me as an outside observer.</p>

<p>I was curious if I would be able to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">./mach build</code>, and if it would take as
long on the second run. Instead I got this interesting output:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>0:00.35 /usr/bin/make -f client.mk -s
0:01.33 
0:01.33 The CLOBBER file has been updated, indicating that an incremental
0:01.33 build since your last build will probably not work. A full/clobber
0:01.33 build is required.
0:01.33 
0:01.33 The reason for the clobber is:
0:01.33 
0:01.33  Bug 1119335 - (DOMString or sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; or ConstrainDOMStringParameters)
0:01.33  needs binding flush (Bug 1103153).
0:01.33 
0:01.33 Clobbering can be performed automatically. However, we didn't
0:01.33 automatically clobber this time because:
0:01.33 
0:01.33   Automatic clobbering is not enabled
0:01.33   (add "mk_add_options AUTOCLOBBER=1" to your mozconfig).
0:01.33 
0:01.33 The easiest and fastest way to clobber is to run:
0:01.33 
0:01.33  $ mach clobber
0:01.33 
0:01.33 If you know this clobber doesn't apply to you or you're feeling lucky
0:01.33 -- Well, are ya? -- you can ignore this clobber requirement by
0:01.33 running:
0:01.33 
0:01.33  $ touch /Users/maxjacobson/src/gecko-dev/obj-x86_64-apple-darwin14.3.0/CLOBBER
0:01.33 make: *** [/Users/maxjacobson/src/gecko-dev/obj-x86_64-apple-darwin14.3.0/CLOBBER] Error 1
0:01.36 78 compiler warnings present.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That’s super interesting! Things I learned from this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s something called “The CLOBBER file” which is some kind of place to
leave little messages about why someone else will need to do a full build
after pulling in a change</li>
  <li>Sometimes it’s possible for mach to do an “incremental build”, which I assume
wouldn’t take very long</li>
  <li>There’s a tool for clobbering, which I guess clears away stuff from earlier
builds, requiring <code class="highlighter-rouge">mach build</code> to do a full, non-incremental build</li>
  <li>Mozilla people make nerdy movie references</li>
</ul>

<p>I took a look at The CLOBBER file by using my fuzzy file opener to look for a
file called CLOBBER and found it, in the root-level of the project. It contains
more details about how to use it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># To trigger a clobber replace ALL of the textual description below,
# giving a bug number and a one line description of why a clobber is
# required. Modifying this file will make configure check that a
# clobber has been performed before the build can continue.
#
# MERGE NOTE: When merging two branches that require a CLOBBER, you should
#             merge both CLOBBER descriptions, to ensure that users on
#             both branches correctly see the clobber warning.
#
#                  O   &lt;-- Users coming from both parents need to Clobber
#               /     \
#          O               O
#          |               |
#          O &lt;-- Clobber   O  &lt;-- Clobber
#
# Note: The description below will be part of the error message shown to users.
#
# Modifying this file will now automatically clobber the buildbot machines \o/
#

# Are you updating CLOBBER because you think it's needed for your WebIDL
# changes to stick? As of bug 928195, this shouldn't be necessary! Please
# don't change CLOBBER for WebIDL changes any more.

Bug 1119335 - (DOMString or sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; or ConstrainDOMStringParameters)
needs binding flush (Bug 1103153).

<p>It’s probably gratuitous to just copy this whole thing in here, especially when
the last few lines are designed to change, but it’s pretty interesting, and I
have a weird superstition about linking to files on GitHub, for example, because
what if that file gets moved and my link goes dead?</p>

<p>This file is like a cache. As long as it stays the same, you can keep building.
As soon as it changes, you need to clobber before you can build. It seems like a
clever solution to me (I especially like the detail about combining clobber
notes so when two people insist on a clobber, they each get the benefit of the
other’s). You just need to remember when to expire the cache, which leaves a
little cookie crumb for the next developer to work on the project.</p>
