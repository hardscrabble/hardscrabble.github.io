![Me in a boat](/img/max.jpg)

I'm a programmer from New York.
I work at Vimeo.
I've worked at [Code Climate] and [CipherHealth].
This is my blog.
When I find myself having a thought at work more than a few times I try to get it down in a blog post.
Often that's stuff related to Ruby and Git.

Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:max@hardscrabble.net), follow me on twitter [@maxjacobson](https://twitter.com/maxjacobson), or check out my github [@maxjacobson](https://github.com/maxjacobson).
I'd especially be happy to chat with people under-represented in the tech industry starting out in their careers.
